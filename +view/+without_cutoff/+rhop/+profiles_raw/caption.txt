Family of solutions with a fixed plateau density ($\rho_p/\rho = 10^{-14}$) illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles. Note that radius and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$). The velocity is given units of speed of light. In this picture the shown family becomes particle mass independent.
