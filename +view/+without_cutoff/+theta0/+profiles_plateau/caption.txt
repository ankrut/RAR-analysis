Degeneracy parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\theta_0\in\qbracket{-5,50}$ and $\beta_0 = 10^{-6}$. In the degenerate regime $\theta_0\in\qbracket{15,50}$ RAR solutions with a distinct core and halo are shown. In this regime each core is well describes by a fully degenerate core (not shown) and each halo by the isothermal sphere (not shown). The transition regime is given for $\theta_0\in\qbracket{-5,15}$ where core and halo become less distinct. Also the plateau becomes cuspy in the density profile. Note that radii are given in units of the plateau radius, densities in units of plateau density, velocities in units of the plateau velocity and masses are given in units of the plateau mass. In this picture all RAR solutions (thin solid lines) overlap in the plateau what links the core and the halo. The vertical line highlights the location of the plateau radius defined at the first minima in the rotation curve of RAR solutions.
