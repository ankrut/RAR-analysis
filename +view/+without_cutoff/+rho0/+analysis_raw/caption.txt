Parameter analysis of the $\rho_0$ family (without cutoff) illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables with respect to the central degeneracy. The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. Note that radius, mass and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$). There are three regimes visible: (1) A degenerate regime with a clear degenerate core, a plateau and a diluted halo for $\theta_0 \gtrsim 15$. (2) A transition regime with less distinct core and halo for $-5 \lesssim \theta_0 \lesssim 15$. (3) A diluted regime with a diluted core followed by a Boltzmannian tail without developing a plateau for $\theta_0 \lesssim -5$.
