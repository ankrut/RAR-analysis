Parameter analysis of the $\rho_0$ family (without cutoff) illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables. The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. Note that radius and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$ and $\rho$). There are three regimes visible: (1) A degenerate regime with a clear degenerate core, a plateau and a diluted halo. (2) A transition regime with less distinct core and halo. (3) A diluted regime with a diluted core followed by a Boltzmannian tail without developing a plateau.
