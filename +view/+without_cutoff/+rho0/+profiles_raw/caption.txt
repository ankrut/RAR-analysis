Family of solutions with a fixed central density illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles. Note that radius and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$ and $\rho$). The velocity is given units of speed of light. In this picture the shown family becomes particle mass independent. There are three regimes visible: (1) A degenerate regime with a clear degenerate core, a plateau and a diluted halo. (2) A transition regime with less distinct core and halo. (3) A diluted regime with a diluted core followed by a Boltzmannian tail without developing a plateau.
