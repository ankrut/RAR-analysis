Degeneracy parameter analysis illustrated with particular values of the density, mass and degeneracy variables for $\beta_0 = 10^{-6}$ and $W_0 = 36$. Those values are obtained at the core, plateau, halo and surface. There are three main regimes: for low central degeneracy values, $\theta_0 \ll -1$ the mass distribution is well described by an isothermal sphere with cutoff. There is a local surface radius minimum when different $W_0 - \theta_0$ becomes low enough such that the halo gets affected. It follows a sharp peak characterizing the transition from cored to cuspy halos. This transition ends with the \textit{halo deficit} regime. The particular mass values follow a similar behavior as for the radius except the sharp peak. In the halo deficit regime the total mass is dominated by the core. The different transition points become clear in the analysis of the degeneracy parameter. Note that radii are given in units of the central density $\rho_0$, velocities are given in units of the core velocity (maximum) and masses are given in units of the core mass.
