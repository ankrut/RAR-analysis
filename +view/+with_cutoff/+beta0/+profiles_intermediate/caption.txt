Temperature parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\beta_0\in\qbracket{10^{-5},10^{3}}$, $\theta_0 = 20$ and $W_0 = 28$. The solution are plotted relative to the core to focus on the morphology of the plateau and halo. There are two main regimes: low temperature  ($\beta_0 \lesssim 10^{-1}$) and high temperature ($\beta_0 \gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Note, that for the chosen parameters, which represent here the \textit{intermediate cutoff regime}, the solutions develop cuspy halos.
