Temperature parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\beta_0\in\qbracket{10^{-5},1}$, $\theta_0 = 20$ and $W_0 = 28$. The solution are plotted relative to the core to focus on the morphology of the plateau and halo. For clearity the hot regime is not shown. Of more interest are two moderate regimes: $10^{-5} \lesssim \beta_0 \lesssim 10^{-1}$ and $10^{-1} \lesssim \beta_0 \lesssim 1$. There is a unique solution (independent of $\beta_0$) in the cold regime (here $\beta_0 \lesssim 10^{-5}$. That solution is well described by a fully degenerate core. Note, that for the chosen parameters, which represent here the \textit{intermediate cutoff regime}, the solutions develop cuspy halos.
