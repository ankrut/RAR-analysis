	\caption{Degeneracy parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\theta_0\in\qbracket{15,50}$ and $\beta_0 = 10^{-6}$. Note that radii are given in units of the core radius, densities in units of central density, velocities in units of the core velocity and masses are given in units of the core mass. In this picture all RAR solutions (thin solid lines) overlap in the core which is very well described by fully degenerate core (red thick line). The vertical line highlights the location of the core radius defined at the first maxima in the rotation curve of RAR solutions.}%
