	\caption{Parameter analysis of the $\rho_p$ family (without cutoff) for $\rho_p/\rho = 10^{-14}$. On the left column the family is illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables. On the right column are particular values of density and temperature parameter. The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. If availbale also at the center. Note that radius, mass and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$).}%
