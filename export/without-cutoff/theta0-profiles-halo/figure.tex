	\caption{Degeneracy parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\theta_0\in\qbracket{15,50}$ and $\beta_0 = 10^{-6}$. Note that radii are given in units of the halo radius, densities in units of halo density, velocities in units of the halo velocity and masses are given in units of the halo mass. In this picture all RAR solutions (thin solid lines) overlap in the halo which is very well described by the isothermal sphere (blue thick line). The vertical line highlights the location of the halo radius defined at the second maxima in the rotation curve of RAR solutions. For the isothermal sphere the halo is defined at the first maxima.}%
