	\caption{Degeneracy parameter analysis illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables for three different temperature regimes: low temperature regime with $\beta_0 = 10^{-6}$ (left), a transition regime with $\beta_0 = 10^{-2}$ (middle) and a high temperature regime with $\beta_0 = 1$ (right). The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. Note that radii are given in units the core radius and masses in units of the core mass.}%
