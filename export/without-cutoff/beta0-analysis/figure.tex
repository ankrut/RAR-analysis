	\caption{Temperature parameter analysis illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables for three different degeneracy regimes: diluted regime with $\theta_0 = -20$ (left), a transition regime with $\theta_0 = 10$ (middle) and a degenerate regime with $\theta_0 = 30$ (right). The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. Note that radii are given in units of the core radius and masses in units of the core mass.}%
