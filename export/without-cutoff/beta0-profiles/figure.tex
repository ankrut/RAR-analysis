	\caption{Temperature parameter analysis illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles for $\theta_0 = 30$ and $\beta_0 \leq 10^2$. In the cold regime $\beta_0\lesssim 10^{-4}$ RAR solutions (solid black line) with a distinct core and halo are practically indistinguishable. In this regime the core is well described by a fully degenerate core (not shown) and the halo by the isothermal sphere (not shown). This unique mass distribution (for a given $\theta_0$) is compared with an intermediate and hot regime. The transition between those two regimes is marked by an minimal central density $\rho_0/\rho_p$. The moderate temperature regime, $\rangesim{\beta_0}{10^{-4}}{1}{}$, shows thermal effects which decrease the core as well as the halo relative to the plateau. In the hot regime, $\beta_0 \gtrsim 1$, the halo varies just slightly while the core forms an extended flat rotation curve. Note that radii are given in units of the plateau radius, densities in units of plateau density, velocities in units of the plateau velocity and masses are given in units of the plateau mass. In this picture all RAR solutions (thin solid lines) overlap in the plateau what links the core and the halo. The vertical line highlights the location of the plateau radius defined at the lowest minima in the rotation curve of RAR solutions.}%
