	\caption{Parameter analysis of the $M_p$-$M_s$ family with $M_p/M = 4 \times 10^{-3}$ and $M_s/M = 10^{2}$. On the left column the family is illustrated with particular values of the radius, mass and degeneracy variables. On the right column are particular values of density, temperature parameter and cutoff parameter. The values of interest are obtained at the core, plateau and halo. If available also at the center and surface. Note that radius, mass and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$).}%
