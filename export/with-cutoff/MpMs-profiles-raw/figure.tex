	\caption{Family of solutions with fixed plateau and surface mass, $M_p/M = 4 \times 10^{-3}$ and $M_s/M = 10^{2}$, illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles. Note that radius, mass and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$). The velocity is given units of the speed of light. In this picture the shown solutions are particle mass independent. Because $\theta_0$ covers a wide range of values the solutions show (1) a degenerate regime with a clearly degenerate core, a plateau and a diluted halo, (2) a transition regime with less distinct core and halo and (3) a diluted regime with a diluted core followed by a Boltzmannian tail (with a cutoff) without developing a plateau. The latter is not shown for clearity.}%
