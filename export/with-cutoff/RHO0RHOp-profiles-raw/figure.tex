	\caption{Family of solutions with fixed central and plateau density, $\rho_0/\rho = 10^{-7}$ and $\rho_p/\rho = 10^{-17}$, illustrated with density, velocity and mass profiles. Note that radius, mass and density are given in a particle mass dependent unit system ($R$, $M$ and $\rho$). The velocity is given units of the speed of light. In this picture the shown solutions are particle mass independent. $W_0$ is a free parameter here. The predicted solutions are mainly in the degenerate regime, developing a degenerate core, a plateau and a halo. On the bottom edge of the $W_0$-intervall the solution touch the transition regime with developing cuspy plateaus. There are no solutions in the diluted regime.}%
